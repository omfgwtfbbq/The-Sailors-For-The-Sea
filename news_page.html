			<h2>Aker Solutions awarded new Johan Sverdrup contract</h2>
			<p class="description"> 

                Equinor and its Johan Sverdrup licence partners have awarded Aker Solutions the contract for 
                hook-up of the fifth platform on the Johan Sverdrup field. 
                At peak the contract will provide jobs for around 1,300 people and have a 
                value of up to NOK 500 million.

            </p>

            <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has 
                been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a
                galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
            </p>
                
            <p>It has survived not only five centuries, 
                but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
            </p>
                
            <p>
                It was popularised in the 1960s 
                with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
                and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of 
                Lorem Ipsum.
