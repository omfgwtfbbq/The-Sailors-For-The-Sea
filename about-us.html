            <p>Sailors for the Sea was co-founded in 2004 by David Rockefeller, Jr. and Dr. David Treadway, two avid sailors who recognized the importance of educating and activating this constituency of ocean enthusiasts.</p>
            <p>In 2018, Sailors for the Sea joined forces with Oceana, the largest international advocacy organization dedicated solely to ocean conservation.</p>
            <p>Together, we are creating a global network of active, engaged ocean champions within the sailing and boating community who are taking action to save our oceans.</p>
            <p>Green Boaters are part of a leading community of ocean conservationists that are taking action to address pressing ocean health issues. By becoming a Green Boater, we will provide you with the latest information and resources on sustainable boating practices and opportunities to act on critical policy issues that are needed to combat plastic pollution, prevent habitat destruction, source responsible seafood and limit overfishing.</p>
            <p>The world’s only sustainability certification for water-based events, Clean Regattas offers sailors, race organizers and marina managers a tool kit of 20 best practices to improve their environmental footprint. Used globally by Opti sailors to the America’s Cup competitors - over 2,500 regattas and 700,000 sailors have participated in the program.</p>
            <p>Kids Environmental Lesson Plans (KELP) are downloadable activities that educate junior sailors and school children about marine science and give them the tools to learn, discover and protect our precious waterways. The lessons are easy to teach and use items found around the house or sailing center. </p>
            <p>Sailors for the Sea is headquartered in Newport, Rhode Island and has two affiliates; Sailors for the Sea Japan and Sailors for the Sea Portugal.</p>
