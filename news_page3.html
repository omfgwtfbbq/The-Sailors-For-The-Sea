			<h2>WORLD’S BIGGEST ARCTIC EXPEDITION BRINGS BACK 1000 ICE SAMPLES TO PREDICT CLIMATE CHANGE</h2>
			<p class="description"> 

                The world’s largest ever polar expedition will return to the German port of Bremerhaven on Monday with rafts of essential data about climate change.
                After being stranded in the Arctic earlier this year due to COVID-19, the Polarstern is heading home for the first time in 389 days.

            <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has 
                been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a
                galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
            </p>
                
            <p>It has survived not only five centuries, 
                but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.

            <p>
                It was popularised in the 1960s 
                with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
                and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of 
                Lorem Ipsum.
