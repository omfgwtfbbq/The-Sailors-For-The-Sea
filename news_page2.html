			<p class="description"> 

                Offshore wind power is fast replacing fossil fuels as a source of clean and increasingly affordable electricity.
                In this episode of Ocean, Euronews meets those working at some of the major new industrial sites to find out more.
                Ã˜rsted's "Borssele 1 & 2" wind farm is one of them, based in the North Sea, 22 kilometres off the Dutch coast.
                It is home to ninety-four wind turbines, which are being attached to the seabed at depths ranging from 14 to 40 meters. When it is complete, it will be the largest offshore wind farm in the Netherlands.
